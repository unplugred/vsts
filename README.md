# VSTS

Some VST plugins I made in C++ with the JUCE framework.

Theyre all available at [vst.unplug.red](https://vst.unplug.red/)

As other open source JUCE projects were an invaluable resource for me in my development process, I offer these as a resource to learn and pull from.

Feel free to utilize parts of this code in your own as you please (so long it's AGPL3),

However, these VSTs are an important source of income for me, and I'd appreciate it if you wont reskin and sell them as is, especially because i already offer them for free.

Pull requests are very much welcome.
